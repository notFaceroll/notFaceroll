## Hi there! 👋


After a couple years of taking programming languages just as hobby, I revinvented myself as a front-end developer (and I hope it is for the best). I can say without a second thought that I am addicted to CSS and I intend to continue studying/practicing to improve/master it. It was like love at first sight. 

At this point I am always trying to improve skills I already have or learn something new. It's a enjoyable routine.


### Some related points

- 🏫 Just started a graduation on Analysis, Development and Integration of Systems at a Federal Institution of Education, Science and Technology in Sergipe, Brazil;

- 📚 <strong>I have knowledge on:</strong>
HTML5, Javascript and CSS3 along with some of its frameworks.

- 🔭 <strong>I'm currently enhancing skills my on: </strong> 
React, Redux, NextJS by doing random projects on the web, most of them from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges);

<!-- - 🤝 With some help I could also manage
'qualquer coisa' -->

- 🌱 <strong>I’m also scheduling myself to learn:</strong>
Typescript, VUE, Angular, as well as learning UI/UX designing skills and its tools (Figma, Adobe XD);


### Random facts

- 🎮 I used to study C# as a hobby (actually it was the first programming language that I studied), to create games on Unity Engine;
- 🎼 One of my other hobbies is play/practice guitar, which I actually came back after a long time (12 years +/-);
- 📖 I can easily lose track of time when study other languages, such as Japanese (yeah, I'm trying), or playing games (specially RPGs).
